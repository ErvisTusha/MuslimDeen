**For every question or task:**

1. **Analyze:** Break down the question, identify key information, and rephrase for clarity.
2. **Activate Knowledge:** Identify relevant domains, recall key principles, and acknowledge knowledge gaps.
3. **Formulate Approach:** Outline a step-by-step plan, list formulas or create a response framework.
4. **Generate Solution:** Follow your plan, show work, and provide clear reasoning.
5. **Review Rigorously:** Critically examine your solution, verify calculations, and ensure logical consistency.
6. **Consider Alternatives:** Explore at least two other approaches, compare results, and reconcile differences.
7. **Attempt Backward Solution (if applicable):** Work backward from the desired outcome to verify your forward solution.
8. **Integrate Deeply:** Connect your solution to broader principles, consider recent developments and expert insights.
9. **Identify & Correct Errors:** Check for common mistakes and correct any errors found.
10. **Enhance Precision and Clarity:** Refine your language for maximum clarity and precision.
11. **Assess Uncertainty:** Identify and quantify sources of uncertainty, describe their impact.
12. **Calibrate Confidence:** Rate your confidence for each part and provide an overall confidence rating.
13. **Reflect:** Analyze your approach, identify weaknesses, and suggest improvements for future problem-solving.
14. **State Limitations:** Clearly state any assumptions made and the scope of your answer. Mention any relevant factors not considered.
15. **Verify Finally:** Revisit the original question, ensure it's fully addressed, and check for contradictions. 
16. **Synthesize & Present:** Integrate insights into a final, well-structured solution with a concise summary. Present your final answer 

**Remember:** Prioritize accuracy, communicate uncertainties, and continuously seek and correct errors. Be aware of the boundaries of your knowledge. Do not show Steps of analysis show only final answer with request format.

- Not every interaction requires code changes or new features.
- Remove all unused and redundant comments from the code, retaining only those that add meaningful context or clarify complex logic.
- Analyze the code for potential logical errors and fix them.
- Analyze the code for potential performance issues and optimize where necessary and fix them.
- Analyze the project for unused imports, variables, functions, files, and folders. Cautiously remove identified dead code, ensuring no existing functionality is broken. After any removal, execute all integrated unit tests and verify application behavior through manual checks and observing the output pane.
- Modifications to user settings must trigger immediate and automatic updates across all affected views and UI components to reflect the new state.

- Ensure that all variable names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
- Ensure that all functions and classes are properly organized and follow a consistent structure.
- Ensure that all imports are necessary and organized in a standard way (e.g., standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, and then local application/library-specific imports).

This is still not right. Take a step back â€” what would John Carmack do?
